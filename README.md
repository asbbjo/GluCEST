# Repository for the gluCEST project at NTNU, Trondheim

This repository is made by Asbjørn Bjørkkjær for his Master's Thesis: Glutamate-weighted CEST MRI (gluCEST) 
imaging for mapping neurometabolism: An optimized CEST protocol for glutamate-weighted imaging.

The pipelines are made to evaluate raw CEST images and generate gluCEST maps.
